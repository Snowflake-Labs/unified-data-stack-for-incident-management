== Overview

This project demonstrates a modern data stack for incident management—a real-world business process that benefits from AI-powered automation and real-time analytics. The platform ingests incident reports from Slack, intelligently classifies them using Snowflake Cortex AI, and provides real-time visualization through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

*This is a small cross-section of a much larger process to show the art of possible.*

=== Architecture at a Glance

----
Slack App → OpenFlow Slack Connector → Bronze Zone → AISQL+ transformations via dbt Projects on Snowflake  → Gold Zone → Cortex Agents → Snowflake Intelligence
                                                                                                                                       → Streamlit Dashboard  
----

=== Key Features

✨ *AI-Powered Classification* - Automatically categorizes incidents using Snowflake Cortex AI +
🖼️ *Image Processing* - AI analysis of screenshots and attachments +
⚡ *Real-time Pipeline* - Near real-time ingestion from Slack via OpenFlow +
📊 *Interactive Dashboard* - Streamlit-based monitoring and management +
🔧 *Modern Data Engineering* - dbt transformations on Snowflake's native runtime

'''

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
* link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation[Snowflake CLI] installed
* link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/setup-openflow-spcs[OpenFlow SPCS] deployed in your account

=== Installation

. *Clone the repository*
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/unified-data-stack-for-incident-management.git
cd unified-data-stack-for-incident-management
----

. *Configure environment*
+
[source,bash]
----
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
----

. *Run automated setup*
+
[source,bash]
----
make install ENV_FILE=.env CONN=<your-connection-name>
----

. *Configure Slack connector*
+
Follow the link:md-docs/SETUP.adoc#slack-connector-configuration[detailed setup guide] to connect your Slack workspace.

*That's it!* You now have a fully functional AI-powered incident management platform.

== What Can You Build?

This project showcases several modern data platform patterns:

=== 🔄 Real-Time Data Ingestion

Stream data from Slack to Snowflake using OpenFlow connectors. Handles text, images, and metadata automatically.

=== 🤖 AI-Native Data Processing

Embed Cortex AI functions directly in SQL transformations:

[source,sql]
----
-- Intelligent categorization from text
ai_classify(text, ['payment gateway error', 'login error', 'other'])

-- Multi-modal analysis with images
ai_classify(attachment_file, ['critical', 'warning', 'info'])
----

=== 📈 Analytics-Ready Data Models

Transform raw Slack messages into structured incident records with:

* Automatic ID generation
* Priority assignment
* Status tracking
* Resolution metrics

=== 🎨 Interactive Dashboards

Real-time Streamlit dashboard with:

* Live incident metrics
* Attachment viewing
* Trend analysis
* Priority-based alerts

== Use Cases & Examples

=== End-to-End Incident Lifecycle

. *Report*: User posts in Slack: _"Payment gateway returning 500 errors"_ + screenshot
. *Ingest*: OpenFlow captures message and image
. *Process*: dbt + AI classify as critical payment issue
. *Monitor*: Dashboard shows new critical incident
. *Resolve*: Team addresses issue, system tracks resolution time

=== Real-World Scenarios

* *Payment outages* → Critical priority, auto-escalation
* *Login issues* → High priority, authentication team notified  
* *UI bugs* → Low priority, added to backlog
