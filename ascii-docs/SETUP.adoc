'''

== Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have:

* *Snowflake CLI* installed (link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation[installation guide])
* *Snowflake connection* configured in `~/.snowflake/config.toml`
* *ACCOUNTADMIN privileges* in your Snowflake account
* *Openflow SPCS* deployment and runtime. Use these link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/setup-openflow-spcs[installation instructions] to set up OpenFlow SPCS within your Snowflake account


=== Key Directories

* *`data/`*: Sample and seed data for testing and initial setup
* *`docs/`*: All documentation in modular format
* *`src/incident_management/`*: Core dbt project with data models
* *`src/sql/`*: Infrastructure setup and raw SQL scripts
* *`src/streamlit/`*: Interactive dashboard application
* *`python_scripts/`*: Utility scripts for reporting and automation

== Installation Steps

This project demonstrates dbt Projects deployment and execution from a local dev machine. Once deployed, you can switch to Snowflake Workspaces to manage further redeployments and test executions.

=== 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/unified-data-stack-for-incident-management.git
cd unified-data-stack-for-incident-management
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
git remote -v
----

=== 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the template and configure your environment:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.template .env
----

Edit the `.env` file and configure all variables except these two (generated later):

* `DBT_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`
* `DBT_SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`

[NOTE]
====
If you change any of the below parameters, be sure to change the `profiles.yml` as well:

* `DBT_PROJECT_DATABASE=v1_incident_management`
* `DBT_PROJECT_SCHEMA=dbt_project_deployments`
* `MODEL_SCHEMA=bronze_zone`
* `DBT_SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=v1_demo_wh`
* `DBT_PROJECT_ADMIN_ROLE=dbt_projects_engineer`
====

=== 3. Setup Snowflake Infrastructure

Use the Makefile to automate the entire Snowflake setup.

==== Option A: Complete Setup (Recommended)

[source,bash]
----
# Run complete installation
make install ENV_FILE=.env CONN=<your-connection-name>
----

==== Option B: Step-by-Step Setup

For detailed information about available Makefile targets:

[source,bash]
----
make help
----

Run each step individually:

[source,bash]
----
# Step 1: Generate snowflake.yml configuration
make generate-yaml ENV_FILE=.env

# Step 2: Setup dbt Projects infrastructure
make setup-dbt-stack CONN=<your-connection-name>

# Step 3: Setup Slack connector infrastructure
make setup-slack-connector CONN=<your-connection-name>
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `<your-connection-name>` with the connection name defined in your `~/.snowflake/config.toml`
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Role setup commands require ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
====

== User Authentication Setup

Execute this step if planning to run the Streamlit app remotely and/or deploy dbt Projects remotely.

=== 1. Generate PAT Token

From Snowsight UI, generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) for the dbt Projects service user tied to the role created in the previous step. Note and copy the token for use during authentication.

=== 2. Generate Key-Pair Authentication

Follow the steps in the link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication[Snowflake documentation]:

[source,bash]
----
# Generate private and public key
openssl genrsa -out rsa_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in rsa_private_key.pem -pubout -out rsa_public_key.pem
----

Then update the user in Snowflake (replace placeholder):

[source,sql]
----
ALTER USER <user name> SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAA...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----';
----

=== 3. Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with:

* `DBT_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<your-PAT-token>`
* `DBT_SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=<path-to-private-key-file>`

== Slack Connector Configuration

After running the Makefile setup, configure the Slack connector in your OpenFlow SPCS runtime.

=== 1. Review Prerequisites

Check the link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/connectors/slack/setup#prerequisites[pre-requisites] for the Slack connector.

=== 2. Create Slack App

Create a Slack app in your workspace using the given link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/connectors/slack/setup#set-up-a-slack-app[manifest].

=== 3. Generate App Token

While creating your Slack app, ensure to generate the App token using at least the below scope:

* `connections:write`

=== 4. Update External Access in Snowflake

link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/connectors/slack/setup#setup-necessary-ingress-rules[Update] the External Access Integration object to add `slack.com` domain for egress from SPCS containers.

=== 5. Configure Connector in OpenFlow Runtime Canvas

Use these link:https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-integration/openflow/connectors/slack/setup#configure-the-connector[instructions] to configure the connector. Ensure to use the database and role parameters created by the Makefile:

image::../screenshots/destination_params.png[Destination Parameters]
image::../screenshots/snowflake_role_params.png[Snowflake Role Parameters]

=== 6. Start and Test

Start the connector and add the Slack app to a channel. Verify these tables are created:

* `SLACK_MEMBERS`
* `SLACK_MEMBERS_STAGING`
* `DOC_METADATA`
* `FILE_HASHES`
* `SLACK_MESSAGES`

=== 7. Test Message Ingestion

Drop a test message in your Slack channel and verify that a record appears in the `SLACK_MESSAGES` table (might take a few seconds).

== Streamlit Dashboard

=== Accessing the Dashboard

After completing the setup, a Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) app will be deployed to your Snowflake account. This enables you to run through foundational scenarios end-to-end.

=== Dashboard Features

* *Metrics Overview*: Critical, high-priority, active, and recently closed incident counts
* *Active Incidents Table*: Real-time view of open incidents with priority indicators
* *Recently Closed Incidents*: Track resolution times and outcomes
* *Attachment Viewer*: Click on incidents with attachments to view images
* *Trend Analysis*: Monthly and weekly incident patterns (when data is available)

=== Managing Incidents via Slack

. *Report New Incidents*: Post messages in configured Slack channels
. *Automatic Processing*: The system will:
   ** Extract incident details from messages
   ** Classify incident type and priority using AI
   ** Process attached images for additional context
   ** Create structured incident records
. *Track Progress*: Monitor incidents through the Streamlit dashboard

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

*Connection Issues*

* Ensure your Snowflake connection is properly configured in `~/.snowflake/config.toml`
* Verify you have ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
* Check that all environment variables are set in your `.env` file

*Prerequisites Check*

[source,bash]
----
make check-prereqs
----

*Slack Connector Not Working*

* Verify the Slack app has the correct scopes
* Check that External Access Integration includes `slack.com`
* Ensure the connector is running in OpenFlow runtime
* Verify table creation in Snowflake

*dbt Project Deployment Issues*

* Confirm authentication is properly configured
* Check that the warehouse and role exist
* Review `profiles.yml` for correct connection settings
