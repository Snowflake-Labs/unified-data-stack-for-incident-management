This document describes the technical architecture, data models, and project structure of the Incident Management platform.

toc::[]

== Overview

This unified data stack uses incident management as an example use-case relatable to its real-world business process which may include registering new incidents, assessing their categories for prioritization, tracking their resolution time, etc for KPI tracking and reporting, but also may include looking at policy documents and other review reports to answer questions and provide insights to the team. 

The idea is to showcase how teams can now bring in multi-modal data into Snowflake with ease and create a more rounded, 360 view of the entire business process. 


== System Architecture

The platform follows a modern data stack architecture built entirely on Snowflake:

=== Components

==== 1. Slack App (Source)

* User-facing interface for incident reporting
* Supports text messages and image attachments
* Integrated via OpenFlow connector

==== 2. OpenFlow Slack Connector (Ingestion)

* Real-time data ingestion from Slack
* Automatic message and file capture
* Stores raw data in Bronze Zone tables

==== 3. Bronze Zone (Raw Data)

* Landing zone for raw Slack data
* Minimal transformations
* Source of truth for all incidents

==== 4. dbt Transformations (Processing)

* Business logic implementation
* AI-powered classification and enrichment
* Incremental processing for performance
* Data quality testing

==== 5. Gold Zone (Analytics-Ready)

* Business-ready data models
* Enriched incident records
* Pre-aggregated metrics and trends

==== 6. Streamlit Dashboard (Visualization)

* Real-time operational monitoring
* Interactive incident management
* Trend analysis and reporting

== Data Models

The dbt Project is composed of following layers:
